		"This morning at 10 am, one Troublesome Triplet that had no money stole £40 from the bank.",
		"The Triplets, Tina, Tia, and Tania, look so much alike, the person in the bank couldn't tell which one took the money.",
		"The person in the bank wanted to be sure he didn't accuse the wrong triplet of stealing, so he alerted shopkeepers across town to let him know when one of the sisters bought anything.",
